# BotThoughtViewer
Simple Python class for drawing what your bot is thinking.

It's different than a replay viewer because you can draw any lines or shapes and represent it all in an easy to view format for debugging.

Pygame and shapely are dependencies. Your bot will fail if this file is imported because the servers do not have these. You've been warned.

I recommend shapely for drawing your shapes.
