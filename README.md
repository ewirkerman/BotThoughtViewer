# BotThoughtViewer
Simple Python (and now Go!) class for drawing what your bot is thinking.

It's different than a replay viewer because you can draw any lines or shapes and represent it all in an easy-to-view format for debugging. (Go version only saves to file).


Python:
Pygame and shapely are dependencies. Your bot will fail if this file is imported because the server do not have pygame. You've been warned.

I recommend shapely for drawing your shapes.

Go:
I use gg (Go Graphics).
