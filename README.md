# BotThoughtViewer
Simple Python class for drawing what your bot is thinking.

It's different than a replay viewer because you can draw any lines or shapes and represent it all in an easy to view format for debugging.

Pygame is a dependency. Your bot will fail if this file is imported because the servers do not have this. You've been warned.
I recommend shapely for drawing your shapes.
